# Implementation Progress

## 1. Refactor & Consolidate Streaming Logic

- Created a new base streaming implementation in `pkg/llmclient/ssestream/base_stream.go`
- Implemented a generic `BaseStream` type that handles common streaming functionality
- Created `BaseStreamHandler` interface to allow provider-specific stream handling
- Refactored Anthropic streaming to use the new base implementation
- Implemented OpenAI streaming using the base implementation
- Next steps: Refactor remaining providers (Gemini, etc.) to use the same base implementation
